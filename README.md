Experimenting with MQTT

## Use
In Linux, open a terminal to run the Publisher -where you can write the
messages you want to publish- and another one to execute the subscriber.
Subscriber just registers to the topic, and prints messages it receives.

## Prerequisites
You need to have *paho-mqtt* installed to use these python sources.
Use:

    pip install paho-mqtt

or refer to: https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/
